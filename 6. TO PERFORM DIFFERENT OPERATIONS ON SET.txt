6.# Python program to perform different set operations


A = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
B = {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 0}
# set union operation
print('Union of A and B:', A | B)
# set intersection operation
print('Intersection of A and B:', A & B)
# set difference operation
print('Difference of A and B:', A - B)
# set symmetric difference operation
print('Symmetric Difference of A and B:', A ^ B)
